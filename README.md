# Portfolio Risk and Return

![Columbia Engineering.](images/Columbia.jpeg)

___
The purpose of this project is to evaluate four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios.

I will produce a Jupyter notebook that contains your data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for key risk and return metrics.

Finally, I will recommend the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with various Libraries and IDE:

* [Jupyterlab](http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2020_fsri/lessons/l01_welcome.html#Jupyter) - An interactive development environment

* [Pandas](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_dataframes.asp) - A useful python library for analysis.

* [Numpy](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp) - A useful Python library for working with arrays.

* [Matplotlib](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp) - A useful python library for low level graph plotting that serves as a visualization utility.
